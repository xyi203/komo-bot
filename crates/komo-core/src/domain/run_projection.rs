//! The run ledger, read out of the session event log.
//!
//! [`Run`] and [`RunStep`] are rows in a disposable database, and every fact
//! they hold is already a durable event: a turn opens with `turn/started`, its
//! calls bracket as `tool/call-started` / `tool/call-settled`, and it closes
//! with one of the three terminal events. Keeping the rows as a *second*
//! authoritative write meant two records of the same turn that could disagree —
//! and after a crash they routinely did, because the row's update is not part of
//! the append that made the event durable.
//!
//! So the rows become a query index over this fold. Nothing here reads the
//! database, and the fold is total: an event log alone reproduces the ledger.
//!
//! Two fields are **not** produced here, and each for its own reason:
//!
//! - [`Run::outcome`] is revisable by what the user says in a *later* turn, so
//!   it is row-held state merged over the projection, never derived from it.
//! - [`Run::recoverable`] folds as *interrupted and unclaimed*, which is not
//!   the same as the reconciled row: a turn with no terminal event is either
//!   running right now or died, and only the process can tell those apart.
//!   Translating one into `Failed` with an interrupted error is the
//!   reconciler's job at startup, not a fact the log states.
