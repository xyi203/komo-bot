//! `/new`: an explicit context boundary inside one conversation.
//!
//! Not a rotate. The operator's home conversation is a single ordered timeline
//! (docs/bot-runtime.md §2 D6), so drawing a line under it is one appended
//! event — nothing is archived, renamed or deleted. What the boundary decides
//! is where the model's default replay starts; everything else about the
//! session (its id, its log, its runs, a turn suspended inside it) carries on.
//!
//! Lives here because three surfaces write it — the chat `/new` command, the
//! TUI, and the api route the desktop client uses — and "which state dies with
//! a boundary" must not be answered three times.

/// working on right now, which is exactly the thing a fresh context does not
/// inherit.
///
/// **Kept**: everything with a lifecycle of its own. Memories outlive any
/// conversation; policy grants (`/approve session`) are answers
/// about what komo may do, not about what it was talking about; a suspended
/// turn and its wakeup registration are still owed an answer. `/new` used to
/// end the session, which coupled all three lifecycles to one keystroke.
