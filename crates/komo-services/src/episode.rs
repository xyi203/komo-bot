//! Assembling an [`EpisodeView`] from the run ledger
//! (docs/episode-learning-framework.md §5.2).
//!
//! One rule lives here so its callers do not each re-derive it: **an episode is
//! only ever a finished run**. Reading a run that is still in flight would hand
//! the learning pass a turn whose steps are still arriving and whose status has
//! not been decided — it would learn from half a turn and record the reason as
//! "unknown", which is indistinguishable from a turn that genuinely ended
//! unresolved.
//!
//! The view carries the ledger's own text, redaction and truncation included.
//! There is deliberately no path back to the un-redacted originals: the
//! learning pass is not a reason to widen what a tool's arguments are allowed
//! to expose.
