//! Learning orchestration (docs/episode-learning-framework.md §5.1): one owner
//! for *when* komo learns from what it did, which episodes the extractor sees,
//! and how the watermark and concurrency behave.
//!
//! The unit is an **episode** — one finished [`Run`] and the tool steps it
//! produced — not a session transcript. A transcript holds user and assistant
//! text only: tool results are never persisted as messages, so an extractor
//! reading one cannot tell whether a command ran, what it returned, or whether
//! the turn ended by delivering or by failing. It learns from the agent's
//! account of itself, which is the one source that cannot corroborate it.
//!
//! Two triggers share this one instance (wiring creates it once): the runtime
//! reports each finished run, and the maintenance sweep picks up whatever the
//! interval left behind. The shared instance is what makes the per-session
//! in-flight guard effective across both.
//!
//! **Ordering matters here.** Learning is dispatched *after* `runs.finish`, not
//! from inside the turn: an episode assembled while its run is still open sees a
//! status that has not been decided and steps that are still arriving.
