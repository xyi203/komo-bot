//! Hybrid vector + lexical search over a chunked corpus.
//!
//! Two corpora use this: the operator's note vault (`wiki_search`) and komo's
//! own conversation transcripts (`session` search). They share everything that
//! matters here — chunk identity, rank fusion, per-file diversification, the
//! mtime bookkeeping an incremental indexer needs — and differ only in what
//! produces the chunks, which is why the vocabulary is `path`/`ordinal` rather
//! than anything about notes or turns.
//!
//! Whatever the corpus, this is a *derived* index, never a store of record:
//! every chunk is reproducible from its source, which is why the backing files
//! are disposable (delete one, re-index, get it back). That is the distinction
//! from [`super::memory`] — memories are durable personal data with no source
//! to rebuild from.
//!
//! And unlike recall, which injects memories automatically, both corpora are
//! **pulled on demand**. Either one dwarfs the memory store, so injecting from
//! them every turn would spend context on material the turn never asked about.
