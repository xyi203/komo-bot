//! Every tool the agent can call, over `komo-core`'s `Tool` trait.
//!
//! Its own crate for two reasons: nothing in the agent references a concrete
//! tool (the loop dispatches through `ToolExecutor`), and this is the half of the
//! old bin crate that changes most often — so it compiles in parallel with the
//! agent instead of ahead of it.
//!
//! `delegate` is the exception and stayed in the binary: a delegation *is* a
//! real agent turn, so that tool holds an `AgentRuntime`.
