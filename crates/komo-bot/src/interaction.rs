//! Interactive gateway layer: lets a chat-channel turn pause for the user's
//! approval mid-execution, and handles the chat control commands (`/new`,
//! `/approve`, `/deny`, `/sethome`, `/wechat login`, `/pair`).
//!
//! Borrowed from hermes-agent's gateway approval. Hermes runs the agent on a
//! worker thread that blocks on a `threading.Event` keyed by session while the
//! async message loop stays responsive and intercepts `/approve` to signal it.
//! komo's tokio-native equivalent:
//!
//!   - each turn is a **spawned task**, so the channel's receive loop keeps
//!     polling while the turn is in flight (no deadlock);
//!   - when a tool needs approval, [`ChatApprover`] sends the prompt to the
//!     chat and **awaits a `oneshot`** registered in [`ApprovalState`], keyed by
//!     session, with a timeout;
//!   - the loop sees the user's `/approve` / `/deny` reply as an ordinary
//!     inbound message, and [`GatewayDispatcher`] resolves the `oneshot` instead
//!     of starting a new turn.
//!
//! The turn's session context (id + reply sink) reaches the approver through
//! the task-local in `services::tool_execution`.
