//! A Python plugin host: run `~/.komo/plugins/*.py` in a child process and
//! call the tools they register.
//!
//! Its own crate for the reason `komo-provider` and `komo-mcp` are: it
//! references nothing else in komo, so it compiles in parallel and an edit here
//! never rebuilds the agent. Nothing here knows about `Tool`, `ToolContext`, or
//! the catalog — the adapter that turns a [`PluginToolDef`] into a komo tool
//! lives in `komo-tools`, and deciding when to mount it lives in wiring.
//!
//! **Out of process, on purpose.** Embedding a Python interpreter would put a
//! GIL next to the async runtime, weld komo to one Python version, and give a
//! plugin the address space of the agent that runs it. A child process costs a
//! pipe and buys isolation: a plugin that segfaults, hangs, or leaks costs the
//! plugins and nothing else, and the supervisor starts a new one.
//!
//! The protocol is newline-delimited JSON over stdin/stdout — one object per
//! line. Requests travel both ways: komo asks for the manifest, a plugin call,
//! or a program run ([`PyHost::run_code`]); the host asks komo to run one of
//! *its* tools on behalf of a running program. The two id spaces cannot collide
//! because komo's requests carry positive ids and the host's carry negative
//! ones. The host also pushes `manifest/changed` unasked when a plugin file is
//! edited, which is what makes "write a `.py` file and the tool appears" work
//! without a restart.
