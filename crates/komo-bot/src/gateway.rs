//! The always-on gateway: a persistent process that hosts background services
//! and ingress channels, mirroring hermes-agent's gateway.
//!
//! hermes runs its cron ticker as a thread *inside* the gateway because the
//! gateway is already the always-on process; ingress (Telegram/Slack adapters)
//! lives there too. komo follows that shape:
//!
//!   - **background services** — the maintenance scheduler from `daemon.rs`,
//!     run as a tokio task inside the gateway (its only host).
//!   - **ingress channels** — pluggable `Channel`s that route inbound messages
//!     through a `MessageHandler` (the wired `AgentRuntime`). None are wired
//!     today; they will be declared in ~/.komo/config.toml and constructed
//!     from there.
//!
//! All tasks share one `watch` shutdown signal; on Ctrl-C the gateway flips it
//! and joins everything. The OS-level supervisor that keeps the *process* alive
//! across crashes/reboots (launchd `KeepAlive` / systemd `Restart=always`) is
//! still deferred — this is the in-process host only.
