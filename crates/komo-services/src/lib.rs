//! The services the tool loop is built out of, none of which knows about the
//! agent above it.
//!
//! `tool_execution` is the centre: `ToolExecutor::execute_round` runs a round's
//! calls against `komo-core`'s `Tool` trait, so it needs no concrete tool and no
//! runtime. Around it sit the pieces tools and the loop share — output bounding,
//! memory enrichment, the skill registry, and the
//! file/search primitives the fs tools are assembled from.
//!
//! `operator_control` stayed in the binary: it reaches up into `agent::daemon`
//! and out to the gateway client, so it is wiring rather than a service.
