//! Operator view DTOs — the serialized shapes the gateway's HTTP endpoints emit
//! and the CLI / GUI clients deserialize.
//!
//! These carry no domain dependency (plain rows over `String`/`i64`/`f64`), so
//! they live in `komo-core` where any HTTP client can reuse them as the single
//! source of truth. The richer operator request/reply enums that *do* wrap
//! domain types stay in `komo::services::operator_control::request`, which
//! re-exports these for path stability.
