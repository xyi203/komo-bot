# No `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` directive on purpose: it makes BuildKit
# fetch the external dockerfile frontend image, which a locked-down registry
# mirror (e.g. fnOS's docker.fnnas.com) 401s on. The daemon's built-in
# frontend (Docker 23+) already supports the `RUN --mount=type=cache` used

# Multi-stage build for the komo gateway.
#   builder : rust toolchain + protoc (feishu's protobuf is compiled at build
#             time), produces the release binary
#   runtime : debian-slim + CA certs (TLS to Telegram / Home Assistant / the
#             LLM API needs a trust store) + libssl3 (the wechat channel's
#             `wechatbot` crate pulls reqwest's native-tls, which dynamically
#             links libssl on Linux — without it the binary won't even load) +
#             tzdata (routines fire on local time — set TZ) +
#             git (`komo skills install owner/repo` shells out to `git clone`;
#             only the single-file `…/SKILL.md` form uses the built-in HTTP
#             client) + curl / python3 / uv (nothing in komo calls any of
#             them — skills do, since a skill is largely "here is the command
#             line for this API"; see the runtime stage for the size tradeoff)
#
# Build for the NAS's architecture, NOT your laptop's. On Apple Silicon:
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 \
#     --build-arg KOMO_BUILD=$(git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD) \
#     -t ghcr.io/solren7/komo:latest --push .
# Deployment lives in compose.yaml (registry pull by default; a Dockhand git
# stack sets KOMO_PULL_POLICY=build to build natively on the NAS).

# alone omits them, so the build fails with "descriptor.proto: File not found".

# skills by raw SKILL.md URL, which uses the built-in HTTP client.
