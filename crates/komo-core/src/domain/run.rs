//! The run ledger — an execution/audit record of every agent turn
//! (docs/personal-agent-roadmap.md §7). One [`Run`] per user turn, with one
//! [`RunStep`] per tool invocation (captured at the single choke point every
//! tool call funnels through, the tool executor (`services::tool_execution`)).
//!
//! Runs are execution state bound to a session, so they live in `state.db`
//! (disposable dev state) alongside sessions/messages — not in the durable
//! memory tables. Every ledger write is best-effort: it must never fail a
//! turn or a tool call (same contract as memory `mark_used`).
//!
//! **These are rows, not facts.** Every field here is folded out of the
//! session event log by `domain::run_projection` and committed through
//! `RunProjectionStore`; nothing writes a run or a step directly any more,
//! because two authoritative records of one turn disagreed after exactly the
//! crash they were meant to survive. What is left on the row is what the log
//! cannot state: the `outcome` a later turn revised, the `learned` watermark,
//! and the reconciler's ruling on whether an open turn is running or dead.
//!
//! `recoverable` marks the resumable set (§6): a turn with no terminal event
//! that no continuation has claimed. The claim is the continuation's own
//! `turn/started{resumed_from}`, so `komo run resume` is at-most-once by seq
//! assignment rather than by a row update racing another reader.
