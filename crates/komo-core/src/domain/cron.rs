//! Routines: work the gateway runs unattended when its moment comes — a cron
//! slot or a named moment.
//!
//! A routine is a [`CronJob`]: a [`Trigger`], an action, and the [`RoutineRun`]
//! history of its firings. Jobs live in the **durable** `cron_job_records` —
//! not in `config.toml`, because an operator can accumulate many of them, and
//! not in a disposable table, because a job silently vanishing means its work
//! silently stops happening. A command job is **operator-authored**
//! (added via `komo cron add` or the loopback-gated api) — the same trust
//! boundary as running `komo gateway` itself — so execution is direct: no shell
//! tool, no approver, no `[policy]` involvement at fire time.
//!
//! A job created in conversation through the agent's `cron` tool is
//! *model*-authored, so that path moves the human decision to creation time: the
//! tool gates every mutation through the `Approver` (a command job prominently,
//! since approving it approves every future execution). By the time a job is in
//! the store the sweep treats both origins identically.
