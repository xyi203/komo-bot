//! Configurable permission policy (roadmap §3): a pure rule engine that decides
//! whether a side-effecting action is auto-allowed, hard-denied, or escalated to
//! interactive approval — consulted *before* the interactive [`Approver`].
//!
//! Pure: no I/O and no config parsing. `config.rs` parses the `[policy]` table
//! from config.toml into these types (via the `parse` helpers here), and
//! `agent::policy_approver::PolicyApprover` wraps the interactive approver and
//! consults a [`Policy`] on every non-`Safe` request.
//!
//! Layering: the policy sits *above* each tool's own hardline floor (shell's
//! refused patterns, HA's blocked domains). Those short-circuit inside the tool
//! before any approver is consulted, so no policy `Allow` rule can unlock them —
//! the policy can only make the gate stricter than a tool's floor, never looser.
//!
//! [`Approver`]: crate::domain::approval::Approver
