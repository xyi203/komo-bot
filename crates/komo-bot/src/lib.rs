//! The agent itself: the tool loop, the gateway that hosts turns, the scheduled
//! sweeps, and the provider client the loop drives.
//!
//! This is the top of the dependency graph below the binary. It depends on the
//! `Tool` trait rather than on any concrete tool, which is why `komo-tools`
//! compiles beside it rather than ahead of it — the two only meet in
//! `cli/wiring.rs`, where the catalog is registered.
//!
//! `llm` and `delegate` live here rather than with their old neighbours because
//! both assemble a *turn*: `llm::assemble` builds the tiered system prompt
//! around `system_prompt`, and a delegation runs a real agent turn on an
//! `AgentRuntime`.
