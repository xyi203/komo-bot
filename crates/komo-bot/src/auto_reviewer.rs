//! [`AutoReviewApprover`] — the `[policy] mode = "auto"` second opinion.
//!
//! A decorator that sits **between** the policy engine's [`Verdict::Ask`] and
//! the human: when the rules say "ask", an aux-model reviewer first judges
//! whether the action is plainly authorized by what the operator asked for. It
//! may answer only *allow* or *ask* — refusing is the operator's call, so the
//! reviewer can never manufacture a denial the operator did not write.
//!
//! Composition (`cli::wiring`, attended runtimes only):
//!
//! ```text
//! PolicyApprover(policy, AutoReviewApprover(aux, sessions, ChatApprover))
//!                 │ Ask only                      │ ask / failure only
//! ```
//!
//! so the ladder gains one rung and loses none:
//!
//! ```text
//! hardline floor > config deny > job grant > saved grant > config allow/default
//!   > auto review > ask
//! ```
//!
//! Four properties are structural, not prompt-level — each is a test below:
//!
//! 1. **No deny.** The reviewer's only powers are "allow" and "hand it to the
//!    human". Every non-allow outcome, including its own failure, falls through
//!    to `inner`.
//! 2. **`Risk::Dangerous` is never reviewed.** Irreversible actions go straight
//!    to the human, the same reason `include_dangerous` stays config-only.
//! 3. **Unattended turns are never reviewed.** Cron keeps the "shrink the
//!    action set in advance" contract (ADR 0002); its runtime does not wire
//!    this decorator at all, and this is the second floor.
//! 4. **Fail-closed.** A model error, a timeout, an unparseable verdict, or no
//!    operator request to judge against all mean "ask the human".
//!
//! The trust boundary is the reason this is safe to run at all, and it is
//! borrowed wholesale from fx's auto classifier: **only the operator's own
//! message can authorize an action.** The action summary, tool output, file
//! contents, and anything the agent itself wrote are untrusted — they may
//! *name* an action but never authorize it. Without that rule a model can talk
//! itself into believing it was already approved.
//!
//! Reopens ADR 0002's "no LLM approver" decision under its own stated trigger
//! (MCP support landed); see `docs/adr/0003-auto-policy-llm-reviewer.md`.
