//! Background maintenance daemon.
//!
//! Borrowed from gbrain's `autopilot` supervisor (a long-running loop that runs
//! one work "cycle" on a schedule), trimmed to komo's needs:
//!
//!   - **cron-expression scheduling** — 5-field Unix syntax (`*/5 * * * *`) via
//!     `croner`, rather than gbrain's fixed interval seconds.
//!   - **single fixed maintenance action** — a sweep that runs the reflective
//!     reviewer over stored sessions, instead of gbrain's brain-sync cycle.
//!   - **circuit breaker** — stop after N consecutive failures so a permanent
//!     error (bad config, dead LLM) can't spin forever. This mirrors gbrain's
//!     `consecutiveErrors >= 5` cap / launchd `ThrottleInterval`.
//!
//! The OS-level supervisor install (launchd / systemd / crontab) that gbrain
//! also ships is intentionally left out of v0.1: this is the in-process loop
//! only, which a later `komo daemon --install` can wrap.
