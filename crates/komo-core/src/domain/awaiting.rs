//! What a session is waiting for, read out of the session event log.
//!
//! A suspended turn is invisible today: it holds no session slot, writes no
//! assistant message, and its row says `suspended` in a ledger nobody watches.
//! The conversation it stopped in looks idle — which is the one thing it is not.
//!
//! [`Awaiting`] is that state, and like the run ledger it is a **projection**:
//! `turn/suspended` says a turn stopped and what for, `wakeup/fired` says the
//! wait is over, and folding the two is the whole definition. The session row's
//! column is a query index over this fold, never a second place the fact lives —
//! clear it and [`project_awaiting`] puts it back.
