//! The session's authoritative event log on disk.
//!
//! A session is a **directory**, not a file, because an append-only log that
//! can never be rewritten still has to have a bounded size:
//!
//! ```text
//! sessions/<session-id>/
//!   manifest.json            header + truncation point + segment table
//!   base.<through-seq>.json  what survives below `truncated_before`
//!   000000.jsonl             sealed
//!   000001.jsonl             active — appended to, never rewritten
//! ```
//!
//! **The manifest is storage metadata, never an event.** It is replaced
//! atomically (temp file → fsync → rename → fsync the directory) and only when
//! the segment table changes — not once per append, or the hot path would pay a
//! directory fsync per turn.
//!
//! **`seq` is assigned here.** A session has one writer; handing callers the
//! right to number their own events is how two ingresses end up committing the
//! same position. [`append_batch`](SessionLog::append_batch) stamps and returns
//! the seqs it assigned.
//!
//! **A durable flush means `fsync`.** The recovery semantics this log exists to
//! support — "no `tool/call-started` means the tool never ran" — are claims
//! about what survived a crash, and flushing a userspace buffer does not make
//! one. [`durable_flush`](SessionLog::durable_flush) reaches the filesystem's
//! durability boundary or it fails.
//!
//! **A torn tail is dropped; a hole is refused.** A process killed mid-append
//! can leave a half-written final line, and that is not a record. A record of a
//! known type that will not parse — or a `seq` that skips — is a gap in history
//! the reader cannot reason about, so it refuses the session instead of
//! guessing. A record of an unknown type is neither: it reads as inert and
//! keeps its seq.
