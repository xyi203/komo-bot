//! Where a turn puts what it made.
//!
//! A workspace holds the user's files: a turn that edits them is changing
//! something that was already there and is theirs. What a turn *produces* — the
//! report it was asked for, a scratch script, a file it downloaded — has nowhere
//! to go that is neither someone's repository nor a temp directory the next
//! reboot empties. So it goes here: `<komo home>/artifacts/<session>/`, one
//! directory per session, inside the workspace's **writable** roots
//! (docs/bot-runtime.md §5.16).
//!
//! Two differences from [`crate::tool_output_store`], which this sits beside and
//! borrows its path sanitizing from:
//!
//!   * **Writable, not read-only.** Tool output is komo's record of a call and
//!     the model may only read it back. An artifact is the model's own output,
//!     so `write` / `edit` resolve into this root and `shell` may
//!     use it as a working directory.
//!   * **Durable, not swept.** A stored tool result ages out after a week
//!     because it is a byproduct. An artifact is the deliberate residue of a
//!     turn — deleting it on a timer would be deleting the thing the user asked
//!     for.
//!
//! Sessions are not isolated from each other: the whole root is writable, so
//! "the report you wrote yesterday" is readable from today's conversation. The
//! per-session directory is a convention about where to *put* things, not a
//! boundary.
//!
//! Nothing is created up front. The directory for a session appears when
//! something is first written into it (`write` creates missing parents), so a
//! conversation that produces no files leaves no directories behind.
