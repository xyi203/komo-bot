//! Session-scoped working todo — the agent's *current focus list* for one
//! conversation, distinct from the durable cross-session `task` store
//! (`domain/task.rs`). This is the roadmap's "会话内 todo" layer (§2/§8):
//! ephemeral, ordered (position = priority), at most one item `in_progress`.
//!
//! Modeled on the精简 intersection of hermes-agent's `TodoStore` and Claude
//! Code's `TodoWrite`: `{content, status, active_form}`, full-list replace on
//! write. Unlike those (which keep it purely in process memory), komo reloads
//! a session per turn, so the list is persisted keyed by session id — but it is
//! still disposable working state, cleared when the session rotates (`/new`).
