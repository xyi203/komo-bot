//! Adapter turning one tool a Python plugin registered into a komo [`Tool`].
//!
//! Everything protocol-shaped lives in `komo-pyhost`; this file is only the
//! seam. One instance per mounted tool, all sharing the host handle — the host
//! is one child process, and a second one per tool would multiply interpreters
//! for nothing.
//!
//! Unlike [`McpTool`](crate::mcp::McpTool), these mount and unmount while komo
//! runs: the point of the plugin host is that writing a `.py` file makes a tool
//! appear. The catalog handles that (see `domain::catalog`); what this file
//! owns is the call.
