//! Turn an *observation* into a change to the memory library.
//!
//! The reviewer used to write straight to the store: every extracted fact became
//! a new candidate unless its normalized text exactly matched something already
//! present. That is enough to stop literal duplicates and nothing else. It cannot
//! see that
//!
//! ```text
//! 用户主要使用 Python
//! 用户最近在转 Rust
//! 以后默认提供 Rust 示例
//! ```
//!
//! are three statements about one thing, the last two of which retire the first.
//! Both survived as separate memories, both were eligible for injection, and the
//! model was left to guess which the user meant.
//!
//! So extraction now produces an [`Observation`] and this seam decides what it
//! *means* against what komo already believes: the same claim restated, more
//! support for it, a conflict with it, an explicit replacement of it, or something
//! new. One place, so the rule cannot fork between the reviewer, the CLI and any
//! future writer.
//!
//! Two invariants worth stating, because both are load-bearing:
//!
//! * **Support is per learning occasion.** [`Memory::record_evidence`] drops an
//!   observation from an occasion it has already counted, so restating a
//!   preference five times in one pass is one observation. The occasion, not the
//!   session, is the unit: the operator's private conversations are all one
//!   permanent home session, and keying on that would mean support never
//!   accumulates there at all.
//! * **Failure degrades to the old behavior.** No related claim, an aux call that
//!   errors, a reply that will not parse, a target id that does not exist — all
//!   land the observation as a plain candidate, which is exactly what the reviewer
//!   did before this existed.
