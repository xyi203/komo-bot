//! Shared construction of a fully-wired `AgentRuntime`.
//!
//! Both the chat REPL (`cli/chat.rs`) and the gateway (`cli/gateway.rs`) need
//! the same agent: identical tools, skills, LLM, and reviewer. The only thing
//! that differs is the `Approver` — interactive at a TTY vs. auto-deny in the
//! unattended gateway — so it is passed in.
//!
//! Tools and hooks come from the plugin roster (`crate::plugins`): the host
//! builds the shared services (storage, workspace, memory, skills), phase 1
//! of the plugin layer contributes every tool tagged with the runtimes that
//! see it, and this module materializes the four executors from that one
//! registry — so a runtime's tool set can never drift from the roster.
