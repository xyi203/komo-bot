//! File-mutation primitives shared by `write` (and next, `edit` /
//! `apply_patch`).
//!
//! The one non-obvious guarantee here is **stale protection**. A write goes:
//! read the current bytes → ask the user → write. That middle step can take
//! minutes (a chat approval), and the file can change under it — an editor save,
//! a `git checkout`, another agent turn. Writing anyway silently discards
//! whatever landed in between. So the write re-reads and compares against the
//! snapshot taken before the prompt, and refuses when it moved. Borrowed from
//! opencode v2's `FileMutation.writeIfUnchanged`.
//!
//! Scope is deliberately narrow: this closes the *approval window*, not a
//! cross-turn one. There is no "the model must have read the file first" rule.
//!
//! The second guarantee is **per-path serialization** of the mutations
//! themselves — see [`WRITE_LOCKS`].
