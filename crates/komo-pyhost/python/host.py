"""The plugin host komo spawns: load `~/.komo/plugins/*.py`, answer calls, and
run the programs komo's `run_code` tool sends.

Speaks newline-delimited JSON on stdin/stdout — one object per line. Requests
travel both ways: komo asks for the manifest, a plugin call, or a program run;
the host asks komo to run one of *its* tools on behalf of a running program.
The two id spaces cannot collide because komo's requests carry positive ids and
the host's carry negative ones.

stdout is the protocol and nothing else: a plugin's own `print` would corrupt
the stream, so stdout is swapped for stderr around every import and every call.

The main loop only reads and routes — every request is handled on its own
thread. That is what makes a program calling back into komo possible at all: the
program blocks waiting for its answer while the loop stays free to deliver it.
