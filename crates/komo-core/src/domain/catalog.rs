//! The shared tool catalog: what the model is told exists, and what the
//! executor dispatches against.
//!
//! Two kinds of entry live here, and the difference is the whole design:
//!
//! * **Built-in tools** are registered during wiring and never leave. They are
//!   the process's identity.
//! * **Mounted tools** arrive later — an external plugin host connecting, an
//!   MCP server appearing — and can leave again. [`ToolCatalog::mount`] hands
//!   back a [`Registration`] whose drop takes them back out, so an owner that
//!   dies (a crashed plugin host, a cancelled task) cannot leave phantom tools
//!   the model will call and nothing will answer.
//!
//! ## Byte stability, and why the snapshot exists
//!
//! Tool schemas are serialized into every request, and a provider's prompt
//! cache matches on exact bytes: entries are name-sorted so the rendered block
//! depends on *which* tools exist, never on the order they were added.
//!
//! Changing the set at all invalidates the cached prefix from the first changed
//! schema token — once, after which it warms again. That is the honest price of
//! mounting a tool, and it is why mounts are batched ([`mount_all`]) rather than
//! applied one at a time: three tools arriving together should cost one
//! invalidation, not three.
//!
//! What must *not* happen is the set changing **inside** a turn. The model was
//! handed one set of schemas; if the executor later dispatches against a
//! different set, a call it was invited to make answers "unknown tool". So a
//! turn takes one [`CatalogSnapshot`] and uses it from its first round to its
//! last — mutations land in the catalog and are picked up by the *next* turn.
//!
//! [`mount_all`]: ToolCatalog::mount_all
