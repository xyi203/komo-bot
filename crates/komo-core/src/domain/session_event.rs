//! The session's authoritative event log — vocabulary, envelope, and the folds
//! that decide what a log *means*.
//!
//! A `SessionEvent` is "one thing that already happened in this session". It is
//! immutable: nothing ever edits an event, and a later fact is expressed by
//! appending another event. Two rules follow from that and are enforced here
//! rather than at each call site:
//!
//! **Fail closed on anything unreadable.** An event type this build does not
//! know may change how the rest of the log must be read, so meeting one is a
//! refusal to reconstruct the session — not a skipped line. The single escape
//! is [`SessionEvent::ignorable`], which a writer sets only on records whose
//! loss cannot affect model history, recovery, or side-effect judgement.
//! Defaulting to *required* means a forgotten marker over-refuses (an
//! inconvenience) instead of silently resuming a gutted session. The first
//! version marks nothing ignorable; the mechanism exists so a later one can.
//!
//! **`seq` is the only order.** It is contiguous and assigned by the session's
//! single writer. [`SessionEvent::at`] is for display and diagnostics: a reader
//! must never sort or reason about recovery by it.
//!
//! This module is pure — no I/O, no storage layout. The segment/manifest
//! machinery that makes a log durable lives in `komo-infra`; what a *reader*
//! may conclude from a log lives here, so both sides cannot disagree.
