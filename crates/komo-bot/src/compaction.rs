//! Replacing a conversation's oldest exchanges with a summary of them
//! (docs/turn-durability.md §4 第三批 3.2).
//!
//! A long-lived session already stopped sending its whole history: the window
//! (`max_history_messages`) replays the newest N messages and the rest are
//! simply not there. That is a silent loss — the model does not know what it
//! stopped seeing, so a question about something decided fifty messages ago is
//! answered from nothing.
//!
//! Compaction turns that loss into a summary. The oldest surface nodes are
//! replaced by one `user/message` that stands where they did, so the model sees
//! *what happened* instead of a gap — and, because a replacement is an append
//! like any other event, **nothing is rewritten**: the shadowed events stay in
//! the log, which is what lets a human transcript still show what the summary
//! covered.
//!
//! Three rules make this safe rather than clever:
//!
//! - **The cut lands where the surface still alternates.** A summary is a user
//!   message, so the node after the range it replaces has to be an assistant
//!   message — two consecutive user messages is exactly what several providers
//!   reject on replay.
//! - **The replacement is validated against the surface it will land on**,
//!   immediately before the append. A replacement citing a node that is no
//!   longer on the surface is not a lost summary: the fold rejects it, and the
//!   session stops being readable at all.
//! - **Every failure means no compaction.** A model error, a timeout, a
//!   surface that will not take the replacement — the window keeps trimming as
//!   it did before, which is the behaviour this improves on, not one it
//!   depends on.

You are compacting the earlier part of a conversation so it can be carried \
forward in less space. What you write replaces those messages: from now on it \
is all the assistant will remember about them.

Write a summary that preserves, in this order of priority:
  1. Decisions made and their reasons — especially ones later work depends on.
  2. Facts about the user, their systems, and their preferences that came up.
  3. Work in progress: what was being done, where it got to, what is left.
  4. Anything the user asked to be remembered or corrected.

Leave out pleasantries, restated questions, and anything already superseded \
later in the excerpt. Do not invent detail that is not there, and do not \
address the user — this is a note to the assistant's future self.

Write it in the language the conversation is in. Prose or short bullets, \
whichever fits; no preamble, no heading, just the summary.";
