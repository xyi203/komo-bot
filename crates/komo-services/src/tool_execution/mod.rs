//! Tool execution as one deep module (architecture deepening plan §6).
//!
//! [`ToolExecutor`] owns the whole execution pipeline the agent loop used to
//! assemble by hand: catalog lookup, per-turn call budget, arg redaction,
//! panic-isolated spawning, transient-error retry, run-ledger recording, the
//! LLM-facing result cap, and error→outcome mapping. Callers hand it a round
//! of model-requested calls plus an explicit [`ToolTurnContext`] and get back
//! `ToolOutcome`s ready for `TurnDriver::step` — they never see lookup, retry,
//! ledger, or cap decisions. Execution policy (result cap, call budget) is
//! **instance-owned** [`ToolExecutionConfig`], not process globals, so two
//! executors can carry different policies.
//!
//! Every execution path funnels through the one internal core, reached via
//! [`ToolExecutor::execute_round`]: the LLM backend only ever *declares* the
//! tools to the provider, so nothing else can run one.
