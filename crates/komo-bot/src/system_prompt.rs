//! Tiered system-prompt assembly, ported from hermes-agent's
//! `agent/system_prompt.py`.
//!
//! The prompt is built in three cache-ordered tiers and joined into one
//! string (stable → context → volatile):
//!
//!   * **stable**   — identity/persona, the operator-authored user profile
//!     (`~/.komo/USER.md`) and machine-wide agent instructions
//!     (`~/.komo/AGENTS.md`, else `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`), all main-agent only,
//!     tool-aware behavioral guidance (only for tools that are actually
//!     loaded), and the skills catalog. Re-read only when a source file's
//!     mtime moves.
//!   * **context**  — the project instruction file (`AGENTS.md`, else
//!     `CLAUDE.md`, else `.cursorrules`) found in the working directory. Stable
//!     **per process**, not per session: it is read from the process's own
//!     working directory, and one conversation is now entered from wherever the
//!     operator happens to be (docs/bot-runtime.md §2 D6). It deliberately does
//!     not follow a turn's workspace — the cache prefix runs tools → system →
//!     messages, so a system tier that moved every turn would invalidate the
//!     whole history behind it. A turn that needs its own directory's
//!     instructions gets them as an `Injected` block at the tail of its user
//!     message, where the new bytes already are.
//!   * **volatile** — day-precision date, model, provider. The only part that
//!     drifts, kept last so the stable+context prefix stays byte-identical and
//!     upstream prompt caches stay warm.
//!
//! Instructions come from two independent scopes — machine-wide and project — and
//! the prompt carries one file from each. Within a scope it is first found wins,
//! most specific first: `~/.komo/AGENTS.md` outranks the shared
//! `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`, and `AGENTS.md` outranks `CLAUDE.md`. That also keeps
//! the common `CLAUDE.md`→`AGENTS.md` symlink from being injected twice.
//!
//! Hermes builds this once per session and caches it; komo builds it once at
//! agent construction (the chat REPL is one sitting = one session; the gateway
//! shares one agent identity across sessions). The date line is **day**
//! precision on purpose — byte-stable for the whole day, so a rebuild never
//! invalidates the prefix cache mid-day. The model queries the exact
//! wall-clock moment via the `time` tool when it actually needs it.

    each time it fires. Choose between the two schedulers by what has to happen: \

    cron job; \"提醒我下午3点开会\" only needs a message delivered, so it is a \
    `reminder`. Write the prompt self-contained — the scheduled turn has none of \
    this conversation's history — and use action=list/disable/enable/remove to \
    inspect and adjust existing jobs instead of adding near-duplicates. Jobs fire \
    only while `komo gateway` runs, their output is delivered to the user's home \
    channel rather than here, and creating or changing one asks the user to approve.";

About your own platform: you run inside the Komo personal-agent gateway. When \
the user asks how to set up, configure, or troubleshoot Komo itself, answer \

services for them:\n\
- Chat channels (feishu, telegram, wechat) are built in. Each is declared in \
~/.komo/config.toml as `[channels.<name>]` with `enabled = true`; credentials \
go in ~/.komo/.env (FEISHU_APP_ID + FEISHU_APP_SECRET, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN). \
Restart the gateway to apply (`komo gateway restart` on macOS; restart the \
container on Docker).\n\
- WeChat (微信) needs no token in .env: after enabling `[channels.wechat]`, \
the user logs in by scanning a QR code — either `komo channel wechat login` in \
a terminal on the host, or by sending `/wechat login` in an already-working \
chat channel (the QR arrives as a photo). Credentials persist in \
~/.komo/wechat/credentials.json; WeChat is DM-only (the bot cannot join \
groups).\n\
- Home Assistant: set HASS_TOKEN (and optionally HASS_URL) in ~/.komo/.env to \
enable the `homeassistant` tool. It queries and controls HA on demand; to \
react to device events, write an HA automation with save_automation rather \
than expecting events to be pushed here.\n\
- Unknown senders must pair before you respond: their first message gets a \
pairing code, which the operator approves with `komo pair approve <code>` on \
the host. Pre-trusted ids go in the channel's `allow_from` list.\n\
- `/sethome` sent in any chat makes it the delivery target for proactive \
output (reminders, daily briefing). `/new` draws a line under the conversation \
so far — it starts a fresh context, not a fresh session, and leaves tasks, \
memories and any pending approval alone; \
`/approve` / `/deny` answer tool-approval prompts.\n\
- `komo doctor` (host terminal) shows config, model, and channel health; \
`komo logs` tails the gateway log.";
