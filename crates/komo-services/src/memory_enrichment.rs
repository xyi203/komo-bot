//! Per-turn memory enrichment (architecture deepening plan §7): everything
//! between "a turn is starting" and "these bytes join the prompt".
//!
//! [`MemoryEnricher::enrich`] owns the whole policy — one store load, scope
//! derivation, L1 pinned selection, L3 recall (fetch wide, inject narrow),
//! the aux screening with its strict-JSON validation and lexical fallback,
//! prompt-block rendering with budgets and safety markers, and the async
//! recall-usage signal. The caller (an LLM adapter) sees only the finished
//! [`MemoryInjection`] — never ids, scores, aux replies, or usage hashes — so a
//! future second adapter can't fork the memory policy.
//!
//! There is deliberately no `MemoryEnricher` trait: one production
//! implementation exists, and tests inject fakes through the existing
//! `MemoryRepository` / `LlmClient` seams.
