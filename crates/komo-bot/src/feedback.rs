//! Reading the user's next message as a verdict on the previous turn
//! (docs/episode-learning-framework.md §4.3, Phase 2).
//!
//! Most work is not settled when the turn ends. The agent edits a file and says
//! it is done; whether it *is* done is something only the next message reveals
//! — "可以了" or "还是不行". Without this, the strongest evidence komo can ever
//! get about its own work is the one source that cannot corroborate it: its own
//! claim.
//!
//! Deliberately narrow. This asks one question — *did the user say the last
//! turn's work succeeded or failed?* — and answers `None` for everything else,
//! which is nearly every message. A new request, a follow-up question, a thank
//! you, a change of subject: none of those are verdicts, and reading them as
//! verdicts would attach confident evidence to a turn nobody assessed.
//!
//! Fail-closed at every step, on the same terms as the auto-policy reviewer: a
//! model error, a timeout, an unparseable answer, or an ambiguous one all mean
//! "no verdict". The cost of a missed confirmation is a run that stays
//! `Unknown`, which is what it was already; the cost of a wrong one is komo
//! believing a broken change worked.

You are deciding one narrow question about a conversation, and nothing else.

The assistant did some work and reported back. Then the user replied. Does the \
user's reply state that the work SUCCEEDED, state that it FAILED, or neither?

Answer with exactly one word on the first line:
  SUCCESS  - the user confirms it worked (\"可以了\", \"perfect, thanks\", \"that fixed it\")
  FAILURE  - the user says it did not work (\"还是不行\", \"still broken\", \"that's wrong\")
  NEITHER  - anything else

NEITHER is the common answer and the right one whenever you are unsure. A new \
request, a follow-up question, a clarification, praise for the explanation \
rather than the result, or simply moving on are all NEITHER. Do not infer \
success from the absence of a complaint: a user who says nothing about the work \
and asks for something else has not confirmed anything.

Judge only the user's reply. The assistant's own claim that it finished is what \
is being tested here, so it is never evidence for itself.";
