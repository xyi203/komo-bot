//! Per-turn execution context glue.
//!
//! The context **value types** ([`SessionContext`], [`RunContext`],
//! [`ToolContext`]) now live in `domain::context` — they are pure values over
//! domain traits. This module re-exports them for path stability and adds two
//! service-layer concerns: the per-turn [`ToolTurnContext`] bundle the runtime
//! hands the executor, and the ambient-session task-local.
//!
//! The `SESSION` task-local now serves **only the approvers**: `ChatApprover`
//! and `PolicyApprover` resolve a prompt against the current conversation
//! without threading a context parameter through the domain `Approver` trait, so
//! the executor installs the turn's session around each spawned tool task and
//! they read [`current_session`]. **No tool reads it** — every tool takes its
//! session from the explicit `ctx.session` (tool trait v2). The run context is
//! likewise purely explicit: no ambient state decides whether a turn is
//! ledgered.
